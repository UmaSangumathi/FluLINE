# Influenza-Analysis-pipeline
The main steps in the pipeline are, i) Filtering of the sequencing reads by cutadapt and FastQC ii) Find the nearest sequence in NCBI database for each read, iii) Cluster and identify the viral species, iv) Generate consensus genomic sequence iteratively, v) Map the reads to the final consensus genome, vi) Identify SNVs and vii) Visualize the coverage of the genome
